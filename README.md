# Blog-web
### Description -
This blog application enables users to create and share personal blogs while fostering community engagement.
Users can register, write, and publish their blogs, explore others' content, and express emotions through comments and reactions.
The platform prioritizes interaction, allowing users to follow each other, receive notifications, and participate in discussions.

### Technology used - <br>
I utilized the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. MongoDB was chosen as the database to store expense data. Express.js 
provided a robust backend framework for handling API routes. React was used for building the frontend user interface, offering a dynamic and responsive experience. 
Node.js was employed to run the server-side code, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend components.

### Features - <br>
<li>User express their emotions as a blog with the images and their feelings in description</li>
<li>Users can edit and delete their post as per need and see all other user blogs just only login.</li>
<li>All these features come together to offer a attractive look to the blogs.</li>

### Deployment
Both the frontend and backend components of the app were deployed separately. The 
frontend was hosted on a web server, while the backend was deployed to a platform like 
render. This decoupled deployment approach allowed for easy scalability and maintenance.
